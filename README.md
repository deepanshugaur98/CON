# CON
A chrome extension to identify gender and age of any profile on social media platforms.


The trained models are stored in the root directory as .pkl (pickle) files after being trained. All the code for the actual extension can be found under the \extension directory.

## It's recommended that the user have the following Python libraries installed to inspect the pickle files:
- NLTK
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Sci-Kit Learn
- Matplotlib
- IO

## For a lucid understanding of the algorithm used behind the project it is advised to explore libraries such as gensim and sklearn natural language toolkit since they are also used in the project.




## How to use

Just open a profile on Facebook and the extension will display a pop up with the predicted age and gender of the person.
